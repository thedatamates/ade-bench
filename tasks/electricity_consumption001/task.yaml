description: Create a model that produces hourly rates for each retailer and plan combination
prompts:
  - key: base
    prompt: |-
      Create a new dbt model called `hourly_rates` with the rate for each hour and day for each retailer + plan combination.

      The model should use the rate_plans seed data and expand it to show:
      - retailer
      - plan_name
      - day_of_week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday)
      - hour (0-23)
      - price_per_kwh
      - daily_charge
      
      Each row should represent one hour of one day for one retailer/plan combo. The model should respect the start_hour, end_hour, applies_weekday, and applies_weekend columns from the rate_plans seed.
