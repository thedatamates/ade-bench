      Someone noticed that the results in the "most_fastest_laps" model are inconsistent, and that model doesn't always return the same top 20 drivers. Can you figure out why this is?

      When you find the issue, fix it so that:
      - It always returns the same top drivers
      - It does not return an arbitrary driver when there are ties
      - If the issue is in other models, fix those too.
